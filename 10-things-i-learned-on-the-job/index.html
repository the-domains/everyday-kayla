I encourage any of you who are on the job hunt tocheck them out! I remember around this time last year when I was going through the process of finding a job, scratch that, the NEVER ENDING process of finding a job (those of you who haven’t had to job hunt in these modern times when you are up against a TON of qualified candidates, you haven’t lived) All that being said, I wish I had discovered TheLadders while I was job hunting; every little bit helps!</p><p>As I am coming upon my one year anniversary at Kohl’s in December, it only seemed like perfect timing to reflect on this past year, my first year, in a corporate environment.

Check it!</p><p><b data-grid-id="ff36b681-607e-48a0-8421-c4a0f08bd0fc">1. Own your own career development</b></p><p>This is vital; if you only take away one piece of advice from this post let it be this. Know that you are in charge of your career! Don’t be naive and think your manager is going to know all your hopes and dreams and put them into reality. You are your own maker and only you can make things happen; empower yourself!</p><p><b>2. Be Open</b></p><p>Be open to different possibilities and career opportunities. No two career paths are the same; you never know where life will take you!</p><p><b>3. Help your co-workers out, you are a team!</b></p><p>Never hesitate to help your co-workers out; know that one day they will have your back!</p><p><b>4. Make goals</b></p><p>You should always have a 5 year goal, that is important. In addition to your 5 year goal, you should have small, attainable goals/steps of how you’ll get to the next step. It’s also a great way to track your own development!</p><p><b>5. Have a mentor</b></p><p>A mentor is a win-win for both parties. It gives you an opportunity to learn from someone other than your manager and is an opportunity to network. For the mentor, it may be an opportunity to “practice” being a manager and allows them to develop their manager skills without actually having to be a manager. My mentor just so happens to be someone on my team. She is someone I can be “real” with about with my career path; I can be real with her about my frustrations and wins that I’ve experienced at work. I know I can count on her for career advice as I navigate the corporate ladder.</p><p><b>6. Take breaks</b></p><p>Especially if your job requires you to sit or be at your computer all day, take breaks! Even if it is to go fill up your water bottle or chat with your co-worker for a little bit, it will help break up your day!</p><p><b>7.  Be grateful</b></p><p>Everyone has days where work is frustrating and it’s important to take a deep breath and be grateful. Remember, you “get to” do this, you don’t “have to” do this. A change in perspective is everything during those crazy times where you’re insanely busy and working extended hours.</p><p><b>8. Develop relationships with your co-workers</b></p><p>We spend a nauseating amount of time at work and with our co-workers, so you might as well have fun! My co-workers and I have become a little family unit and I truly love who I work with. We talk in the morning over coffee, hear about each other’s weekends, eat lunch together, and most importantly support each other.</p><p><b>9. Be a sponge</b></p><p>Take it all in! Ask questions and observe; I have learned so much by asking questions and observing and in the end, this has helped me immensely. Your co-workers and managers notice your willingness and excitement to learn!</p><p><b>10. Trust your gut</b></p><p>You know when something feels right, and you know when something does not. All I can advise is to trust your gut, whether it has to do with career development, working relationships, or a design decision (white buttons or blue buttons?!), your gut is always right.</p><p>What lessons have you learned on the job?
