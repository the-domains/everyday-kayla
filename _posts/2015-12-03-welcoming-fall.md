# Welcoming Fall
![](http://www.everydaykayla.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/two-dogs-wrapped-in-a-blanket1.jpg)

One of my favorite blogs [Bleubird][0] wrote a list of goals for fall; it's a refreshing and thoughtful idea to create a list of goals at the beginning of each season. It's a healthy mental check to challenge our behaviors with an opportunity to change. I'm definitely going to be making it a habit to do this at the beginning of each season.

Here are a few things that I am looking forward to this season...

Eating | caramel apples, popcorn, and homemade soupDrinking | warm lemon water and chai teaPracticing | more pianoMastering | work life balanceLearning | new recipesTrying | a barre class; since I grew up dancing, I have a feeling I would fall in love with barre!Playing | music while cooking dinner (which leads to impromptu kitchen dancing of course)Finishing | our apartment; there are some bare walls craving artwork!Reading | anything; I would like to get back in the habit of reading before bedRemembering | to simplify, slow down, and take it all inWearing | lots of layers; being comfortable and cozy everydayCooking | all the time; I want our apartment to constantly smell of cinnamon, roasted veggies, and herbsWorking | on wedding planning! lots and lots of wedding planningTraveling | with Steven; more weekend road trips please!Wanting | more hours in the day; 24 just isn't enough!

Happy Fall!
